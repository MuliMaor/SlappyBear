### How To Play
You must press all the red markers - and only the red ones! - before the time is up, in order to slap your opponent before they can slap you.
You get three lives. How long can you survive?
### Instructions
in order to get the game running:
* Download the zipped game folder from this repository.
* Unzip the folder and enter it.
* Open the SlappyBear exe file withing it.

Note that the exe file must stay in the same folder as the game's data folder.
### Future Development Possibilities
This project provides a solid foundation for a casual mobile game. Here are some areas where it could evolve to enhance its appeal:

* The addition of features such as high scores and leaderboards can boost user engagement.
* Exploring unique boss encounters would introduce depth and excitement to the gameplay.
* The incorporation of custom visual and audio assets can further distinguish the game with a unique brand identity.
  
Please note that the current version of the game uses publicly available assets for demonstration purposes. Custom assets could be incorporated in future iterations to elevate the project.
The project is currently for viewing and demonstration purposes only and should not be redistributed or used for other purposes.
